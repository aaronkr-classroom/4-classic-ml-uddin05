# Chp 3-4 Classic ML

This chapter applies the classical machine learning models introduced in Chapter 3 to the datasets built in Chapter 2. Using sklearn, we evaluate how well each model performs on held-out test sets. The goal is to build intuition about model behavior and performance relative to one another. Three datasets are used:

1. The iris dataset (original and augmented)
2. The breast cancer dataset
3. The MNIST handwritten digits dataset in vector form

We will conduct experiments with six models:

1. nearest centroid, 
2. k-NN, 
3. naive Bayes, 
4. decision trees, 
5. random forests, and 
6. SVMs
